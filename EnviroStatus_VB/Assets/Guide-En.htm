    <p>This app shows (sad) truth about air pollution in your vincinity.</p>
    <p>It simply collects (merges) data from different sources:</p>
    <!-- gwiazdka, i br, zeby nie bylo zmniejszenia tekstu -->
    * GIOS, polish government's agency - sensors takes many measurements<br />
    * DarkSky, although it is weather forecast service and not a sensors network, but it also presents official weather alerts, and e.g. UV index, cloud coverage, visibility, dew point and apparent temperature<br />
    * Airly, sensors mainly for Particulate Matter (mainly Europe)<br />
    * IMGW hydrology, Polish official hydrology service, status of rivers<br />
    * IMGW meteo, Polish official meteo service, mainly wind data<br />
    * radioactiveathome, radiation sensors (world)<br />
    * Foreca, for current maximum and minimum world temperature

    <p>
        Sensors should be less than 10 km (Airly, GIOS) or less than 50 km (radioactive).
    </p>
    <p>
        For technical reasons, data from three former sources are received by API,
        and from rest - via web page simulation.
        And for Airly and DarkSky rules, you have to create account on their portal.
        After creating account, you get API key - please enter it in app Settings.
    </p>
    <p>
        In measurement Details you can see <a href='https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/ambient-(outdoor)-air-quality-and-health'>WHO standards</a>,
        <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20120001031">levels from polish law</a>,
        almost identical as levels in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32008L0050">UE Directive.</a>

        You can select what app marks (with exclamations) - values over WHO or over EU limits.
        In 'WHO mode', one exclamation means value over annual average, two - daily average, and three - 2× daily average.
        In 'EU mode', one exclamation means value over limit, two - over information threshold, and two - over alert treshold.
    </p>
    <p>
        App allows you to create list of locations - under given name, it stores latitude/longitude
        and list of nearest sensors. App doesn't check for new sensors' instalations;
        but you can use 'GPS' option and save location under same name as before.
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, app calculate how humidity would change if you replace whole air in room,
        and change temperature (volume of room, and target temperature, can be set in Settings).
        You get relative humidity, and how many water you should pump into air to get recommended humidity (40-60 %).
        To see this data, please right click (tap) on Humidity measurement.
    </p>
    <p>
        App creates own (calculated) measurement: apparent temperature.
        But it is not real apparent temperature, as app uses only ambient temperature and humidity,
        and doesn't have wind speed nor radiation effect included.
    </p>

    <p>Try this app and be happy :)</p>
